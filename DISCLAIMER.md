- Deleting files under `C:\Windows\System32` and modifying Svchost group registry values can break Windows if used incorrectly.
- For high-assurance needs (enterprise endpoints, sensitive systems, or when you cannot establish scope), reimaging the device may be the correct response.
- If this is not your personal device or you are under an organisational security policy, follow your incident response procedures and consult your IT/SOC team.
